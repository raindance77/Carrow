 <div class="tab-folder">
		<div id="tab1" class="tab-content"><p>PM FRIENDLY; SUPER W.I.P.</p></div>
		<div id="tab3" class="tab-content"><p> Background:<br><br>Carrow walked through the modern city, a relic of a forgotten past, but his presence, hidden in plain sight, carried a weight far heavier than any living soul could imagine. His body was a testament to dark magic—scarred yet handsome, held together by threads glowing faintly in the shadows. His white hair, tousled as if by constant winds of a storm no one else could feel, framed his sharp features. The stitches and marks across his skin did nothing to mar his appearance; instead, they added to his strange allure, a reminder of a battle he had long since lost—but never truly escaped.<br><br>
Centuries ago, Carrow had been a warrior, fierce and proud, falling only after a grand battle that left the earth soaked with blood. But death had not claimed him. Instead, a dark magician had torn him from his well-earned rest, stitching his flesh back together, and binding his soul to the magician's will. Reanimated, a pawn of dark sorcery, Carrow had served, bound to his resurrector by the cursed threads of dark magic that pulsed with each order given.<br><br>
For years, he had played the role of a loyal servant, carrying out the magician’s cruel commands without question, his soul trapped in limbo. But Carrow had not been idle in those years of servitude. He had watched. He had learned. In secret, he studied the dark arts, absorbing the magic that held him captive, understanding the binds that shackled him. Bit by bit, he unraveled the secrets of his own curse, pretending to remain obedient while plotting his master’s downfall.<br><br>
The dark magician, bloated with arrogance, never suspected. And when the time came—when the magician was at his most vulnerable, consumed by his own twisted power— Carrow struck. In the dead of night, he turned on his creator with a fury born of centuries of servitude and rage. His hands, strong and scarred, moved with the precision of a warrior and the cunning of a magician. The battle was not a long one. It was brutal, savage, and Carrow granted his master no mercy. He ripped through him like a storm of vengeance, tearing the life from him in a way that ensured the magician would not return, not even by the darkest of spells.<br><br>
When the final blow landed, Carrow felt the bonds of servitude snap like brittle chains, his connection to the magician shattered. He had won his freedom—ripped it violently from the hands of the one who had enslaved him. But the victory was hollow. As the magician’s body lay crumpled in the blood-soaked dust, Carrow stood over him, breathing heavily, waiting for the final release that never came.<br>
His soul remained tethered—not to a master, not to the world, not to a god. The dark magic that had once bound him to servitude still clung to his existence like a shadow he could never shake. He was free, yes, but not truly alive. He had severed every tie, destroyed every chain, and yet his soul lingered in the limbo between life and death, far beyond his reach.<br><br>
He walked among the living, yet was nothing like them. Immortal, ageless, his body no longer aged or decayed, but neither did it truly live. His silver eyes, dull with the weight of his existence, saw the world with a distance that rendered him detached, as though nothing could truly pierce the veil between him and everything around him. He was drawn to the living, yet kept them at arm’s length. Attachment was dangerous, he knew—he had learned that long ago.<br><br>
Though the dark magician was gone, Carrow's curse persisted. In his hands, he held the power of magic he had learned in secret, yet it could not touch the one curse that truly mattered. He could raise the dead, control the shadows, and weave the threads of fate, but he could not free himself.  He was trapped in a world to which he no longer belonged, a warrior with no battle left to fight. Despite these powers, Carrow held a deep disdain for them, refusing to wield magic unnecessarily, for it was magic that had bound him to this fate. To him, it was futile—a hollow force, incapable of delivering the one thing he craved: release.<br><br>
Freedom had come at a price, and Carrow now realized the bitter truth: some victories are not victories at all. And so, he wandered, alone, a relic from a time long past, cursed to roam the modern world, forever searching for an end that would never come. <br>
